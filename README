Build Instructions

Download browserify
`npm i -g browserify`

Run build_script
`./build_script`

Open the html file in a browser

Remarks

I tried to build this with as few libraries as possible, as it looked like it
could be done with just html css js.

Doing things without jquery helpers was a bit more difficult than anticipated.
